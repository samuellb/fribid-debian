This program dumps the ASN1 structure and contents of a file. It will create
textual and binary dumps of the file in the current directory.

Individual \"blobs\" in the file are dumped to filename.1.2.3.4.bin/txt. Each
such text file is appended to all.txt, and structure.txt which is filtered
to not contain number sequences (such as keys and personal numbers).
