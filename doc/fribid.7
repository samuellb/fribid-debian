.SH NAME
fribid \- a web browser plugin for BankID

.SH DESCRIPTION
FriBID is a web browser plugin for BankID, a kind of electronic ID (e-legitimation) that's used in Sweden.

.SH LIMITATIONS
FriBID supports both file-based electronic IDs (e-legitimation på fil) and card-based electronic IDs (e-legitimation på kort), with some limitations:
.LP
.IP -
The new file formats (NGE/NGP) from the official client of version 4.15.0.14 aren't supported.
.IP -
It's not possible to fetch new file-based IDs.
.IP -
To change your password/PIN you need to use other programs (such as openssl with the pkcs12 sub-command).
.IP -
To be able to use card-based IDs you need to do some configuration, see http://wiki.fribid.se/sidor/SmartCards (in Swedish).
.LP
The official software, BankID Säkerhetsprogram, does not have these limitations but is proprietary software and supports less platforms and browsers.
.LP
FriBID is only compatible with the second version of BankID, and not the older system that uses Java applets.

.SH IMPORT AND EXPORT
FriBID uses the directories
.B cbt
and
.B .cbt
(a hidden directory) in your home directory to store file-based electronic IDs. To import and export your IDs, just copy them to or from any of these directories. If neither of the directories exist you can simply create a new directory with either of the names. Note that only the P12 file format is supported, the NGE and NGP formats used in the latest versions of the official software are unsupported.

.SH USING FRIBID
FriBID will start automatically when you visit a web page that uses BankID for the log in system or to sign information. You can test your BankID software \- whether you use FriBID or BankID Säkerhetsprogram \- at:
.LP
http://test.bankid.com/

.SH NOTES
FriBID is
.B not
an official BankID client, and you use it entirely at your own risk!
