This directory contains scripts that can be used for testing that FriBID
works properly. The scripts do not check the validity of certificates
and can't generate valid certificates, only test certificates. The
following scripts are available:


sign.sh - This script tests signature generation. You need to to have a
certificate to successfully run this test, but even if you don't have
any certificate you should still get a certificate selection and
password entry dialog.

reqcert.sh - This script tests a "certificate request", which is the
first step of getting a certificate. You should get window where you can
choose a password, and after running the script you should have a test
file in "~/cbt". The second step can currently not be tested with these
scripts.
