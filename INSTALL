Debian/Ubuntu
-------------
Under Debian/Ubuntu, you can install all dependencies with:

    apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev libssl-dev gettext libp11-dev opensc

For GTK 3 use libgtk-3-dev instead. Then compile and install with the
following command (assuming you use sudo):

    ./configure && make && sudo make install

If you need smartcard support, please follow this guide:
http://wiki.fribid.se/sidor/SmartCards (in Swedish)


Other distributions
-------------------
To build FriBID you need the following software:

  * A C99 compiler (like gcc)
  * GNU Make
  * pkg-config
  * gettext
  * GTK 2.18 or later (including GTK 3)
  * GLib 2.8 or later
  * OpenSSL 0.9.8 or 1.0.0
  * And development files (headers) for the three
    libraries above.

If you want smartcard support, you also need:

  * libp11
  * A PKCS#11 module for your card (or OpenSC which supports many cards)
  * Drivers for your card
  See http://wiki.fribid.se/sidor/SmartCards (in Swedish)


To build and install FriBID on a Unix-like system with sudo, use the
following command:

    ./configure && make && sudo make install

This will perform a system-wide installation, so FriBID will be available
for all users. If you only want to install FriBID on your own user account,
you can use the following command (which doesn't require administrative
rights):

    ./configure --current-user && make && make install

This will install FriBID on your user account only.

The plugin will show up in your web browser after it has been restarted.
You may need to uninstall Nexus Personal / BankID SÃ¤kerhetsprogram. Note that
FriBID will show up as "Nexus Personal" in your browser (for compatibility
reasons) but the description and the filename should be "FriBID version X"
and "libfribidplugin.so", respectively.
