To build FriBID you need the following software:

  * A C99 compiler (like gcc)
  * GNU Make
  * pkg-config
  * gettext
  * GTK 2.18 or later
  * GLib 2.8 or later
  * OpenSSL 0.9.8
  * And development files (headers) for the three
    libraries above.

If you want smartcard support, you also need:

  * libp11
  * A PKCS#11 module for your card (or OpenSC which supports many cards)
  * Drivers for your card
  See http://wiki.fribid.se/sidor/SmartCards (in Swedish)


To build and install FriBID on a Unix-like system with sudo, use the
following command:

    ./configure && make && sudo make install

This will perform a system-wide installation, so FriBID will be available
for all users. If you only want to install FriBID on your own user account,
you can use the following command (which doesn't require administrative
rights):

    ./configure --current-user && make && make install

This will install FriBID on your user account only.
