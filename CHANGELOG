  * Added a manual page.
  * Corrected the version number of GTK in the INSTALL document.
  * Moved the source files for building Debian packages to a separate
    repostitory at http://github.com/samuellb/fribid-debian

    Thanks to Marcus Carlson and Henrik Nordström.

    client (4.15.0.14).
  * Replaced the dependency on the NSS crypto library with OpenSSL.
  * Added a simple web page for testing certificate requesting.

0.1.3 - 2010-04-16
  * Fixed a crash that occurred with certain certificate/identity files.
    Thanks to Marcus Carlson who tracked down this bug.
  * Made FriBID look for certificates/identity files in ~/.cbt as well
    as ~/cbt. Thanks to Marcus Carlson for this patch.
  * Made it possible to specify a path for the library files. Normally
    these are stored in /usr/lib/, but some distributions store them
    in /usr/lib64/ on 64-bit platforms (for example Slackware).
  * Added an ASN1 dumping tool, which can be used to analyze certificate/
    identity files.
  * Small improvements in performance and documentation fixes.


0.1.2 - 2010-03-24
  * Fixed a bug with optimized builds that caused passwords to not be
    cleared from RAM when they where no longer needed.
  * Fixed a compatibility problem with sites that request signing
    without specifying a subject (personal number).
  * Implemented "non-visible data", which is used in signatures at some
    sites, such as Skatteverket.
  * A better random source is now used for the encryption keys for the
    temporary NSS database.


0.1.1 - 2010-02-20
  * Fixed a bug that sometimes caused PIDs of exited child processes
    ("zombies") to be left around.
  * Added a "fuzzer" script that can be used to check for bugs.
  * Compatibility with Google Chrome / Chromium.
  * Prevent the password from getting swapped out. Thanks to Linus Walleij
    for this patch!
  * Fixed some build problems completely on FreeBSD, and partially on
    OpenBSD. Thanks to Markus Bergkvist!
  * Fixed a browser crash on some 64-bit platforms. Thanks to Håkan Kvist
    for this patch!
    

0.1.0 - 2010-02-03
  * All occurrences of the password in RAM are now cleared when they are
    no longer needed.

    for .deb and .tar package creation.
