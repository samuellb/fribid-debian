1.0.0 - 2011-09-25
  * [security update] Many fixes of potential problems, discovered with
    tools like Sparse and Clang --analyze, and manual review of the code.
    None of the problems are known to be remotely exploitable, but all
    users are encouraged to upgrade.
  * Fixed problem with enrollment of new certificates on Chrome/Chromium.
  * Added the TextCharacterEncoding parameter. Needed by minameddelanden.se
  * Improved parsing of SubjectDN. This fixes a problem with enrollment on
    Handelsbanken.
  * The MIME type "application/x-personal-signer" is now claimed to be
    supported. This makes the log in work on Handelsbanken.
  * Fixed a problem on 64-bit platforms. Thanks to Edward Tjörnhammar.
  * Subjects are now sorted by their display name.
  * An initial size is now specified for the "text to be signed" box. This
    fixes a problem on Ubuntu 11.10, where it was invisible.
  * Improved "configure" script with more reliable 64-bit path detection.


0.3.1 - 2011-07-11
  * Added support for numeric OIDs in distinguished names. This should
    make enrollment with Handelsbanken work, but is untested so far.
  * Build fixes for FreeBSD (Robert Andersson).
  * Support for --localedir and --mandir in the configure script.
  * Compatibility with GTK 3.0.
  * Implemented the "Reset" function in the Javascript interface. I haven't
    seen it used anywhere, but it's implemented in Nexus Personal.
  * The plugin version is now reported to the browser.
  * Some small improvements.


0.3.0 - 2011-04-24
  * [security update] Fix display of ISO-8859-1 strings and strings with
    invalid UTF-8. Previously the "text to sign" box was just empty in
    these two cases, so the user could not see what he or she was signing.
  * Implemented support for obtaining file-based e-IDs. Thanks to Erik
    Andersson, Örjan and "krypto" for testing this!
  * All Javascript function arguments have been limited to 10 MiB.
  * Fix compilation with OpenSSL 1.0.0.
  * Made the plugin identify itself as "Nexus Personal" instead of "FriBID".
    This fixes compatibility with some sites, such as Skandiabanken.
  * Add a "stub" of the Webadmin object, which is needed for
    test.bankid.com
  * Made all parameter names case insensitive.
  * Code refactoring.


0.2.2 - 2010-12-18
  * Fixed a 64-bit type error. (Henrik Nordström)
  * Implemented the ServerTime parameter which is used on at least
    www.forex.se, and possibly other sites. (Samuel Lidén Borell)
  * Fix incorrectly detected library path on 64-bit systems. (Samuel Lidén
    Borell)
  * Code refactoring/cleanup. (Samuel Lidén Borell)


0.2.1a - 2010-10-11
  * Fixed a problem with one of the Makefiles.


0.2.1 - 2010-10-10
  * Added a manual page.
  * Corrected the version number of GTK in the INSTALL document.
  * Moved the source files for building Debian packages to a separate
    repostitory at http://github.com/samuellb/fribid-debian


0.2.0 - 2010-09-17
  * Support for card readers. See http://wiki.fribid.se/sidor/SmartCards
    Thanks to Marcus Carlson and Henrik Nordström.
  * Updated the version string to the latest one of the official Linux
    client (4.15.0.14).
  * Replaced the dependency on the NSS crypto library with OpenSSL.
  * Added a simple web page for testing certificate requesting.
  * The Debian package no longer suggests that Java should be installed,
    Java hasn't been used by BankID sites for a long time now.
  * Add Chromium to the list of recommended browsers in the Debian package.
  * Code cleanup.


0.1.4 - 2010-05-16
  * Fixed a problem that occurred on Försäkringskassan's web site. Thanks
    to mannuz who discovered this problem.


0.1.3 - 2010-04-16
  * Fixed a crash that occurred with certain certificate/identity files.
    Thanks to Marcus Carlson who tracked down this bug.
  * Made FriBID look for certificates/identity files in ~/.cbt as well
    as ~/cbt. Thanks to Marcus Carlson for this patch.
  * Made it possible to specify a path for the library files. Normally
    these are stored in /usr/lib/, but some distributions store them
    in /usr/lib64/ on 64-bit platforms (for example Slackware).
  * Added an ASN1 dumping tool, which can be used to analyze certificate/
    identity files.
  * Small improvements in performance and documentation fixes.


0.1.2 - 2010-03-24
  * Fixed a bug with optimized builds that caused passwords to not be
    cleared from RAM when they where no longer needed.
  * Fixed a compatibility problem with sites that request signing
    without specifying a subject (personal number).
  * Implemented "non-visible data", which is used in signatures at some
    sites, such as Skatteverket.
  * A better random source is now used for the encryption keys for the
    temporary NSS database.


0.1.1 - 2010-02-20
  * Fixed a bug that sometimes caused PIDs of exited child processes
    ("zombies") to be left around.
  * Added a "fuzzer" script that can be used to check for bugs.
  * Compatibility with Google Chrome / Chromium.
  * Prevent the password from getting swapped out. Thanks to Linus Walleij
    for this patch!
  * Fixed some build problems completely on FreeBSD, and partially on
    OpenBSD. Thanks to Markus Bergkvist!
  * Fixed a browser crash on some 64-bit platforms. Thanks to Håkan Kvist
    for this patch!
    

0.1.0 - 2010-02-03
  * All occurrences of the password in RAM are now cleared when they are
    no longer needed.
  * Fixed an error that occurred on sites that were sending null bytes in
    the challenge parameter.
  * Better error handling.
  * Renamed the plugin filename to libfribidplugin.so to prevent
    installation conflicts with Nexus Personal.
  * Fixed two compile errors on 64-bit platforms.
  * Fixed a couple of non-critical errors in the makefiles.
  * Added build files for the Debian package format, and makefile rules
    for .deb and .tar package creation.
  * Better error handling.
  * Made it impossible for a single web page to open multiple log in windows.
  * Made person filtering work when authenticating. This is used on web sites
    that let you enter your personal number as a separate step in the log in
    process.


0.0.9a - 2009-11-13
  * Added license headers to a few files that lacked this information.
